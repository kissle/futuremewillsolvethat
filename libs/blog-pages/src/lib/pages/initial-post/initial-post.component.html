<h2>Initial Post</h2>

<section>
    <p>
        So my Angular app is running and I created a simple Component to hold my Inital Post you are currently reading. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea for this project is to start really lean and ugly and don't care about the best setup in first place. 
        Like other ideas it neads space to grow and get more detailed. As long as I'm making progress I'm happy. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The point is to get the things running one by one and document my approaches. 
        So while this blog will help you understand how angular works it will become more detailed over time explaining how I 
        got to the next step. 
    </p>
    <p>
        That's why this page is plain html without any styling.

    <h3>What I did so far</h3>
    <p>
        Since I feel quite limited with possibilities to nicely format everything and give detailed explanaitions I'm staying 
        short for today only mentioning major steps  
    </p>

    <h4>Start a project using nx</h4>
    <p>
        <a href="https://nx.dev/angular-tutorial/01-create-application">nx</a> is a build system which provides basic features to 
        develop <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> Single Page Applications (SPA). 
    </p>
    <p>The command you should use is </p>
    <code>npx create-nx-workspace@latest</code>
    The app is called <code>blog</code>.
    <h4>Create a new library called <code>blog-pages</code></h4>
    <p>
        I'm using VS Code and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console">nx console</a> extension.
        It gives me handy features to generate librarys or components. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternatively you can run this command in your termianl which should result in the same output. 
    </p>
    <code>npx nx generate @nrwl/angular:library blog-pages-lib --addTailwind --buildable --importPath=@futureme/blog-pages-lib --publishable --standaloneConfig --no-interactive --dry-run </code>


    <h4>Create this InitialPostComponent</h4>

    <code>npx nx generate @nrwl/angular:component initial-post --project=blog-pages-lib --module=blog-pages-lib --export --path=libs/blog-pages/src/lib/pages --no-interactive --dry-run </code>

    <h4>Route to InitialPostComponent in the AppModule</h4>
    <p>
        In the AppModule you need first to import the InitialPostComponent from your blog-pages-lib 
    </p>

    <code>import {{ '{' }} InitialPostComponent {{ '}' }} from '@futureme/blog-pages'</code>

    <p>
        Then you need to provide the route to it in your imports by using the <code>RouterModule</code>. 
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        RouterModule.forRoot([
            {{ '{' }}
            path: '',
            component: InitialPostComponent
            {{ '}' }}
        ]) 
    </code></pre>
    
    <h4>Run your server</h4>
    <p>
        When everything is correct you should be able to run your dev server with 
    </p>

    <code>npx nx run blog</code>
